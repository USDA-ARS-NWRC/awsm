Configuration File Reference
============================

The configuration file to run AWSM is an extension of the SMRF configuration. A configuration
file used with AWSM will have sections specific to SMRF and sections specific to AWSM. The
configuration sections get combined into one file to make it easier to keep track of configuration
options. See :doc:`../../getting_started/create_config` for an example of a simple configuration file.
