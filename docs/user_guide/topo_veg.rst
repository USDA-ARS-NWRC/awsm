Advanced ``topo.nc`` Setup
==========================

Creating the ``topo.nc`` following the :doc:`../getting_started/basin_setup` will
result in a useable topo file that can be used to run AWSM. However, sometimes more
customization is needed to fit a particular study or watershed. This guide will go
through the layers within the ``topo.nc`` and how add/change these fields.

The following layers are required in the ``topo.nc``:

1. Digital elevation model
2. Vegetation type
3. Vegetation height
4. Vegetation extinction coefficient
5. Vegetation optical transmissivity
6. Basin mask (optional)
